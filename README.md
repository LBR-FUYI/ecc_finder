# CCDNA
Chimeric extrachromosomal Circular DNA (eccDNA) detector using Illumina and ONT sequencing

We previously developed the mobilome-seq that selectively sequence extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) forms of actively transposing transposable elements (TEs) in order to characterize active TEs in any plant or animal tissue (Lanciano et al.  PLoS Genetics, 2017).
The CCDNA pipeline is dedicated to the detection of chimeric eccDNA in Mobilome-seq by Illumina and ONT sequencing.
